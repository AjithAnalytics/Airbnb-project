# Airbnb Analysis

## project overview
Airbnb delves into a comprehensive exploration of Airbnb data. Airbnb has revolutionized the travel and property management industry, making it crucial to analyze its data to gain insights into pricing, availability patterns, and location-based trends. This project employs MongoDB Atlas, Streamlit, and data visualization techniques to provide an in-depth analysis.
 ```
## Key Technologies and Skills
```bash
* Python
* Pandas
* MongoDB
* power BI
```
## Programming hints
```http
Write the program to below content
1)Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
2)Extract the data from mongoDB
3) The data undergoes preprocessing and cleaning. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency to enhance its quality and usability.
4)Convert the cleaning data indo suitable file formate
5) Creat the Power BI dashboard and visualize the Airbnb analysis
```

## Installation
Install need project packages
* Pandas: Essential for data handling and manipulation.
```bash
                            import pandas as pd
```
* NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and data handling.
```bash
                            import numpy as np
```
* MongoDB: Data Extraction from MongoDB
```bash
from pymongo.mongo_client import MongoClient
```
* Plotly Express: A library for creating interactive data visualizations
```bash
                            pip install plotly
```
* Datetime: Essential for datetime handling
```bash
                            import datetime as dt
```
# ETL Process for Data Migration from MongoDB

```bash
1. MongoDB Data Retrieval: Acquire the Airbnb dataset from MongoDB for analysis.
2. Handling Null and Duplicate Values: Implement preprocessing techniques to address missing data and duplicates.
3. ETL and Dataframes: Perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations to convert the data into structured dataframes for analysis.
```
## Features Analysis

* Stay Duration Analysis: Investigate the minimum and maximum nights guests typically stay.

* Cancellation Policy Impact: Understand the impact of cancellation policies on booking trends.

* Accommodation Metrics: Explore accommodates, bedrooms, and beds-related statistics.

* Review Analysis: Examine total reviews, average review scores, and the distribution of reviews.

* Bathroom and Pricing Analysis: Investigate bathroom count, pricing, cleaning prices, and extra guest charges.

* Guest Inclusion Trends: Analyze the number of guests included in bookings.

* Host Insights: Explore host-related metrics, including host response time, response rate, and the number of properties hosted.

* Geographic Analysis: Investigate the market and country-level distribution of Airbnb listings.

* Availability Trends: Visualize property availability for the next 30, 60, 90, and 360 days.

## Power BI

Power BI, or Power Business Intelligence, is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end-users to create their own reports and dashboards.
